# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis

This project classifies the sentiment of Twitter messages or tweets; these
messages are classified as positive or negative for a sentence or a tweet. I
accomplish this by mining tweets using Twitterâ€™s search API and subsequently
processing them for analysis.

First, you need to get a Twitter API. To do so, Sign in for a Twitter developer account.
For that, you need to have a verified Twitter account, not as a celebrity but with a phone number and email verified.

### Python modules:
* Textblob: for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common 
            natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 
* tweepy: An easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API.
